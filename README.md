# Kruipeding
A creepy crawler. Seemed like a fun little toy project and programming excercise. I'd like to see what a simple crawler might gather if it
starts at some given website and just plainly follows links. What kind of web will it spin?

## Requirements
- Python 3.13
- UV
- An internet connection
- Time
